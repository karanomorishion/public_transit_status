# Public Transit Status with Apache Kafka

This project constructed a streaming event pipeline around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem. Using public data from the Chicago Transit Authority we will construct an event pipeline around Kafka that allows us to simulate and display the status of train lines in real time.

A monitor a website to watch trains move from station to station is provided.
